# statistical_writing

Here is where examples of my statistical reports are kept.

Example 1 is a more recent example, covering the topic of Generalized Estimating Equations in small sample modelling. Written in LaTeX, and run on Python.

Example 2 comes from my undergraduate studies, covering the topic of Bayesian Gibbs Sampling using a hierarchical priors structure. Written in Rmarkdown.
